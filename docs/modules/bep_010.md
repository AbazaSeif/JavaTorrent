---
The extension protocol is designed to overcome the 'flaw' within the BitTorrent protocol in that we only have 8 bytes to indicate which extensions we support.
This extension uses one bit and adds a second step to the handshake process. During the second step the clients share their list of known named extensions and
to which id they map them.

This basically allows for infinite extensions to the protocol without having to reserve the ids. The client is responsibly to create the map of extension to id
mapping. The only conflict is when two different extensions share the same name. This is being avoided by the standard naming of 'xx_yyyy' where xx is the
indication of the client who introduced the extension and yyyy being the name of the extension.

## Usage

```java
TorrentClient client = new TorrentClient.Builder()
    // Register the Extension protocol on which the ut_metadata protocol is based.
    .registerModule(new ExtensionModule.Builder()
        // Register new features which rely on the Extension Protocol.
        .build())
    // ... other configuration
    .build();
```
