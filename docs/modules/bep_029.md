---
The uTorrent Transport Protocol is designed to allow users to run Torrents in the background without draining their internet connection.
The uTP implementation targets to have a certain delay on the packets and throttling down when the delay is too high.
Effectively limiting the torrent bandwidth usage to whatever is the free bandwidth.

**Be Advised**
The implementation is currently in it's early stages and has little to no optimizations yet. The rewrite for 0.6 made it significantly more stable but it's
still terribly slow.

## Usage

```java
UtpModule utpModule = new UtpModule.Builder()
    .listenOn(6881)
    .build();
TorrentClient client = new TorrentClient.Builder()
    .registerModule(utpModule)
    .setConnectionDegradation(new ConnectionDegradation.Builder()
        .registerDefaultConnectionType(utpModule.getUtpSocketClass(), utpModule.createSocketFactory(), TcpSocket.class)
        .registerConnectionType(TcpSocket.class, TcpSocket::new)
        .build())
    // ...other configuration
    .build();

```
