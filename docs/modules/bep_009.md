This extension introduces the concept of 'magnet links' and a way to download the torrent files. These links contain minimal information in order to join the
peer swarm and to initiate the torrent. Upon starting a torrent based on the magnet link the client first connects to several peers waiting for someone to
include the metadata size during the handshake. Once we know the size we can start downloading the blocks which make up the torrent file. Once the torrent
file is completed we can verify it by the hash of metadata file. When the hash matches we can continue the download as if it was started by a torrent file.

## Usage

```java
TorrentClient client = new TorrentClient.Builder()
    // Register the Extension protocol on which the ut_metadata protocol is based.
    .registerModule(new ExtensionModule.Builder()
        // Register the ut_metadata protocol.
        .registerExtension(new UTMetadataExtension(torrentFileFolder, downloadFolder))
        .build())
    // ... other configuration
    .build();

Torrent torrent = new MagnetLink("magnet:?dn=GIMP+2.8.16-setup-1.exe&xt=urn:btih:c8369f0ba4bf6cd87fb13b3437782e2c7820bb38", client).getTorrent();
client.download(torrent);
```
